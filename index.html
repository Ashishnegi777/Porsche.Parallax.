							<p>
								The Porsche 911 is a two-door  high performance rear
								engine sports car introduced in September 1964 by Porsche
								AG of Stuttgart, Germany. It has a rear-mounted flat-six engine
								and originally a torsion bar suspension. The car has been
								continuously enhanced through the years but the basic concept
								has remained unchanged. The engines were air-cooled until the
								introduction of the 996 series in 1998

								At a staggering altitude of 6.734 meters above sea level, an
								unprecedented feat was achieved on December 2nd when
								accomplished racing driver Romain Dumas etched his name into the
								annals of automotive history. This remarkable accomplishment
								unfolded at the summit of the west ridge of the Ojos del Salado
								volcano in Chile, an awe-inspiring location that stands as the
								highest point any car has ever reached.

									When the first 911 rolled off the Porsche lines in 1963, no

									history is a lifelong source of appeal.
